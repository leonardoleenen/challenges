# Request

Build a webapp that can display an organization structure. You must use React as the base
framework but you can use any toolkitforthe UI components. We would like to be impressed by your CS
skills so please do not use a library to go through the employees to be displayed (you can use a UI library
to draw each employee,though)

Your app should display in a way thatis clear and intuitive the organizational structure partially and
navigable up to the fully expanded structure.
Yes,thatʼs allthe instructions weʼre going to give you,the restis entirely up to you.

# What is important / evaluation criteria
* How well your solution solves the problem, including performance (try notto make many requests to
the api, as less as possible, but also avoid preloading all ofthem). Will it work with more than a couple
of dozens employees? Will it work with anAPI with 100k employees?
* Sense of design
* The architecture of your solution,the overall picture.
* Is it easy to install and run.
